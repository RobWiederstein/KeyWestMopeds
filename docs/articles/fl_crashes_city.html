<p>From Florida Traffic Crashes Report Manual, there were 634 city codes in <code>fl_city_codes</code>. Some cities have multiple codes in <code>fl_city_codes</code>. For example, Jacksonville is coded as both “0225” and “0238” and Miami as “0166” and “0191”. The U.S. Census bureau listed 412 unique cities in <code>fl_city_pop</code>. Additionally, the U.S. Census bureau also used “.” to abbreviate “Saint” to “St.” so the period was eliminated from the city field. When the two dataframes were merged, there were 383 successful matches.</p>
